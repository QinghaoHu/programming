x1 <= x1' + w1
x2 <= x2' + w2
x3 <= x3' + w3

for all edges (u, v, w) 
	if u > v + w
		u = v + w

Bellman - ford
You can also use spfa but unnassary

if you want to get non negative solution

add 
x0 - xi <= 0

if you want to get the smallest solution
see the transform

u - v <= w
-u + v >= w
v >= w + u
